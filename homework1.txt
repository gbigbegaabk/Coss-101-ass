Entertainment– for watching videos, listening to music, and playing games

E-LEARNING ANT ITS USES   
E-learning is a way of learning through computers and the internet. It allows students to attend classes, watch lessons, and submit assignments online. It’s flexible, easy to access, and helps people learn from anywhere.  
E-learning makes education more accessible. It saves time, reduces travel, and helps students learn at their own pace, especially during times like lockdowns or in remote areas.

RESERCH
Good research is about finding the right information to solve a problem or answer a question. It means being focused, using reliable sources, and being honest about where you got your info. A good researcher is curious, asks the right questions, and takes their time to understand the topic. It’s not just about copying things from the internet, but really understanding what you're writing. At the end, your work should be clear, well-organized, and make sense to whoever reads it.
